As a part of master thesis I developed an extend version for the tetris game with a study platform to measure the performance and experience of the players while playing Tetris under the influence of music.

# Code Editor

You can open the code on any code edtors. Also, this supports windows, Mac and Linux operating systems.

## Frontend

Run `npm install` to install the required npm packages

Run `ng serve` to build, deploy and execute the webplatform on the web browser.

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` and open it on your web browser. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Don't forget to add databse connection for the backend. (For instructions - please read README.md file residing inside the "Tetris---Backend-Code" folder)

Happy Gaming!
